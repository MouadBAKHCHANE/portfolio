# Mouad Bakhchane
## Data & BI Consultant | Microsoft Certified

> *"Companies call me when their BI has become unmanageable: inconsistent figures, fragile pipelines, unreadable dashboards, uncontrolled KPIs."*

I help businesses structure, analyze, and visualize their data to make better decisions. As a former financial market expert turned Data Consultant, I bridge the gap between business needs (ROI, P&L, KPIs) and technical reality (SQL, Python, DAX).
